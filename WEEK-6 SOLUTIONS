# **Case Nr-1**
## **Solution**
 1.Different Hardware.
 2.Different Operating systems.
 3.Different Programming Languages.
 4.Different Implementors.
 5.Connected to Internet- Internet Protocol will deal the differences.
 
 # **Case Nr-2**
 ## **Solution**
 1.The distributed system uses a common set of communication protocols (probably Internet protocols).
 2.It uses an defined standard for representing data items (to deal with heterogeneity of hardware).
 3.It uses a common standard for message passing operations (or for invocations).
 4.It uses a language independent standard for representing data structures.
 5.BLOB must be published, the new and existing clients will access it.
 
 # **Case Nr-3**
 # **Solution**
  Accessing a protected operation-
  1.Identity of the user making the request.
  2.Verifying the identity of the user, that he is allowed to access the protected operation.
  3.Ensure that the identity supplied comes from the user it request to be and not from some other user
    pretending to be that user.
  4.Stopping others from tampering the requests.
  5.Information must be protected from unauthorized users.
  6.Encryption of messages for protected operations.
